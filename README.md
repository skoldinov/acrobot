# Deep Learning PyTorch template

Over the last years I've built several deep learning projects in PyTorch, either for work or for academic projects. What I realized was that I was actually writing and writing the same things, except for a few things. Therefore, in order to avoid writing always the same pipeline, I wrote my own deep learning template in PyTorch! ðŸš€

## Structure

```
â””â”€â”€â”€ assets/ : store results, images or major checkpoints
|
â””â”€â”€â”€ dataset/ : store the dataset involved on your tests
|
â””â”€â”€â”€ src/ 
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ data/ 
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ dataset.py : dataset class
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ transformations.py : data augmentation pipeline
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ losses/
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ metrics/ 
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ models/
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ model.py : custom model
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ trainer.py : trainer class
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ utils/ 
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ plots.py : plots sample of images, metrics and so on
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ utils.py : set seed, early stopping and so on
|
â””â”€â”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€â”€ settings.yaml : settings for the current experiment 
â””â”€â”€â”€ train.py : training pipeline with logging, cuda and tensorboard support
```

This is still a work-in-progress template and I would be happy to receive comments and feedback based on your professional experience!
